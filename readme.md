Imagine your life as a game — and you are the main character.

Every day you wake up with choices.
Go to the gym? Study something new? Talk to someone?
Every small decision shapes who you become.

But in real life…
you don’t see your XP.
You don’t see your Strength rising.
You don’t see your Charisma improving.
You don’t see how much Discipline you’ve built.

This app changes that.

🎮 Welcome to Your Real-Life RPG.

You start with six core stats — just like a game character:

Strength (STR)

Intelligence (INT)

Charisma (CHA)

Health (HLT)

Wealth (WLT)

Discipline (DIS)

When you complete real missions in life…
your stats go up.
You earn XP.
Your level increases.
You literally watch your character grow.

Walk 5000 steps? → STR +10 XP
Study 30 minutes? → INT +10 XP
Talk to someone new? → CHA +10 XP
Meditate 10 minutes? → HLT +12 XP
Work on a skill? → WLT +15 XP

Small actions become visible progress.

🔥 Three Difficulty Paths

You choose how hard you want your journey to be:

Easy missions for small daily wins

Medium missions for focused effort

Hard missions… locked behind a challenge

The twist?

🗝 Hard Missions unlock only after a 100-day streak.

Complete any mission every day for 100 days —
prove your consistency —
and the Hard tier unlocks.

Only the truly disciplined reach it.

Hard missions give huge XP rewards, letting you level up faster than ever.

🧭 Your Stats, Your Story

Some people will grow strong in Strength and Discipline.
Some will focus on Intelligence and Wealth.
Some will balance Charisma and Health.

The stats you choose to improve tell your personal story.
Your profile becomes a mirror of who you are becoming.

And your Level shows your lifetime progress.
It never goes down — only up.

🌱 Stay Consistent. Become Better.

Your Discipline (DIS) grows the more consistent you are.
Miss days, and some stats may slowly decay —
just like real life.

But your level stays with you forever.
You’ve earned it.

⭐ **This isn’t just an app.

It’s your personal evolution tracker.**

Turn your life into a game.
Level up your skills.
Build habits that matter.
Become the main character of your own story.

Welcome to the journey.
